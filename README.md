# OLIST Market Analysis üáßüá∑

This project provides a comprehensive market analysis using data from OLIST, a popular e-commerce platform in Brazil. The project covers data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using SQL queries, while also presenting the data in a more understandable way with interactive visualizations using Power BI.

## Data Set

The dataset used in this project is a rich e-commerce dataset publicly available on Kaggle, provided by OLIST. It contains detailed information about orders, customers, products, payments, sellers, and more. You can access the dataset here: [Kaggle OLIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce-olist-dataset)

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to deeply analyze customer behavior, sales trends, logistics performance, and market dynamics on the OLIST platform. The analyses obtained through the combined use of SQL and Power BI can contribute to the platform's growth strategies, guide business decisions, and help identify areas for improvement.

## Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **SQL:** Used for retrieving, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data from the database. (Specify the database you used, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL.)
*   **Power BI:** Used for creating interactive visualizations, reports, and dashboards.
*   **[Related Tools (e.g., DBeaver, SQL Developer, etc.)]:** Tools used for writing and running SQL code. (Optional)
*   **GitHub:** Used for version control and sharing of project files.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

*   **`sql/`:** This directory contains the SQL files used for data analysis:
    *   `data_cleaning.sql`: Queries used for cleaning missing and inconsistent data in the dataset.
    *   `customer_analysis.sql`: Queries used for analyses such as customer segmentation, purchasing behavior, and customer lifetime value. ‚Äç‚Äç
    *   `sales_analysis.sql`: Queries used for analyses such as sales trends, product performance, and revenue analysis. 
    *   `logistics_analysis.sql`: Queries used for analyses such as shipping times, delivery performance, and logistics efficiency. 
*   **`powerbi/`:** This directory contains the Power BI report (.pbix) file and/or screenshots.
*   `README.md`: This file containing general information and usage instructions about the project.

## Power BI Visualizations

The Power BI report offers interactive visualizations such as (Please add brief descriptions of the visualizations you created in Power BI and include screenshots if possible):

*   **Sales Trends:** Line chart showing sales change over time. (Screenshot to be added)
*   **Customer Segmentation:** Pie chart or map visualization dividing customers into different groups. (Screenshot to be added)
*   **Product Performance:** Bar chart showing best-selling products and top revenue-generating products. (Screenshot to be added)
*   **Logistics Performance:** Metrics showing average shipping time and delivery success. (Screenshot to be added)
